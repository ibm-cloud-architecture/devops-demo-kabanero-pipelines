# Extend, Build & Deploy Kabanero Pipelines
Developers that use [Kabanero](https://kabanero.io/) pipelines often times have to extend these pipelines to do certain tasks that do not come
in the out-of-the-box Kabanero pipelines. These tasks may include code coverage, or use third party applications like
[Pact Broker](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker), [Sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) or [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/)
to full-fill software requirements. Currently, there are not many methods to manage and version control your Kabanero 
pipelines, and the goal of this repository is to help you get going.

You will learn how to package, host your pipelines in different environments such as Git or Artifactory and use
these pipelines to automate the process of updating the [kabanero custom resource](https://kabanero.io/docs/ref/general/configuration/kabanero-cr-config.html) 
to a respective host where your Kabanero pipelines exist.

# Overview
This repository includes 3 [directories](pipelines), `experimental`(pipelines that are not production-ready and are considered,
proof of concept),`incubator`(pipelines that are not production-ready and require further development to satisfy the stable criteria.) 
and `stable`(pipelines that are production ready).

This repository also contains multiple [/pipelines/](./pipelines/incubator) such as [artifactory-package-release-update](pipelines/experimental/artifactory-package-release-update), 
[git-package-release-update](./pipelines/experimental/git-package-release-update) and [mcm-pipelines](pipelines/incubator/mcm-pipelines).
 The repository also contains a [./run.sh](./run.sh) script file which helps automate the process of deploying your pipelines as git releases.

There are multiple approaches on packaging and releasing your pipelines. Both the `artifactory-package-release-update` & `git-package-release-update` pipelines do the same thing, package, manage
and deploy your custom pipelines, except hosted in different environments. For example, the `artifactory-package-release-update` pipeline, packages your
pipelines and host them onto Artifactory, where as the `git-package-release-update` are hosted as git releases. The goal of this repository
is to get you going in managing your custom made pipelines. 

The `mcm-pipelines` contains the tasks of building, testing, pushing an image and a healthcheck of a nodejs application. It also
does a `sonar-scan` for code coverage.
   
# Pre-requisites
* Install the following CLI's on your laptop/workstation:

    + [`docker cli`](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
    + [`git cli`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    + [`oc cli`](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/welcome/index.html)
    + [`Openshift 4.3.5 with CloudPak for Apps`](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-applications)
    + [`tekton cli`](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli)
    
# Package pipelines
To package your pipelines you must run the `run.sh` script as shown below: 
Enter `1` to set up your environment, containerize your pipelines and release them to a registry. 
Ensure to update the variables (optional if you want to deploy an image of your pipelines onto a registry)
in [env.sh](ci/env.sh) with your corresponding registry values.

``` bash
# Publish images to image registry
export IMAGE_REGISTRY_PUBLISH=false

# Credentials for publishing images:
export IMAGE_REGISTRY=your-image-registry
export IMAGE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=your-image-registry-username
export IMAGE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=your-image-password

# Organization for images
export IMAGE_REGISTRY_ORG=your-org-name

# Name of pipelines-index image (ci/package.sh)
export INDEX_IMAGE=pipelines-index

# Version or snapshot identifier for pipelines-index (ci/package.sh)
export INDEX_VERSION=SNAPSHOT
```

``` bash
$ ./run.sh

# Host pipelines on Artifactory
### Pre-reqs
You need to deploy [Artifactory](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/gse-devops/tree/master/cloudpak-for-integration-tekton-pipelines#artifactory) on your openshift cluster

You need to generate an [API Key](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/User+Profile). Then you need to go to
[artifactory-config.yaml](configmaps/artifactory-config.yaml) and update the `artifactory_key`. Once done, run the following
commands:

```bash
oc project kabanero
cd ./configmaps
oc apply -f artifactory-config.yaml
```

Then go to [pipelines](pipelines) make any modifications you want to do to any of the pipelines, or include your own.
If you do include your pipelines, use the [skeleton](pipelines/skeleton) to add your modified pipelines, tasks,
bindings, and templates. 

``` bash
cd pipelines/experimental
oc apply --recursive --filename pipelines/experminetal/artifactory-package-release-update/
```

Go to the dashboard and verify that the `artifactory-package-release-update-pl` has been added to the tekton dashboard
Go to section [Create tekton webhook](#create-a-tekton-webhook) to create your webhook.
Once you are done with that go to your forked repository and make a change and your tekton dashboard should create a 
new pipeline run as shown below:

You could also manually trigger your pipelines
![](gifs/artifactory-package-release-update-pl-rn.gif)

Where the `git-source` is defined as the pipeline resource with key [url] and value [github repo url] 

The end result should look like the following:

![alt text](img/artifactory-package-release-update-pl-rn.png)

# Host pipelines on Git (Manually)
You will first need to package your pipelines. To do that go to the [package-pipelines](#package-pipelines)
After you are done with that step you will notice a new file named `default-kabanero-pipelines.tar.gz` under
`ci/assets` which includes your pipelines along with their corresponding checksum values. You will use this file to upload
as an asset on github.

But first, create a new repository i.e named `pipeline-server` on github and follow the steps as shown on the gif.

# Deploy packaged pipelines onto kabanero namespace 
### Pre-reqs
You need to create a github 
[token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
and need to create a `.gitconfig` file such as:
    
```bash
~/Documents/devops-demo-kabanero-pipelines/ cat ~/.gitconfig

[user]
      name = firstname.lastname
      email = your-github-email@email.com
[github]
      token = your-token
```
    

You need to fork this repo and clone via https.
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/devops-demo-kabanero-pipelines 
cd devops-demo-kabanero-pipelines
```
You need another repository to host your pipelines. i.e [pipelines-server](https://github.com/oiricaud/pipeline-server/releases) to create git-releases.
  
``` bash
mkdir pipeline-server
cd pipeline-server
git init 
cat >> README.md
    Hello this is my pipeline-server repo press (ctrl+d to save)
git add README.md
git commit -m "added README.md"
git push
```

Now is the time to make any changes you wish to make, or you can use the custom pipelines we have provided for you.

# Create a tekton webhook 
### Pre-reqs

You need to create an access token on the tekton dashboard or cli in the kabanero namespace.
Earlier you created a github token on the github dashboard. You will need to get that token or generate another one and 
paste it below.
![](gifs/access-token.gif)

Webhook Settings:

    Name: devops-demo-kabanero-pipelines
    Repistory-url: your forked repo url goes here
    Access Token: Token you generated previously 

Target Pipeline Settings
        
    Namespace: kabanero
    Pipeline: Choose artifactory-package-release-update-pl or git-package-release-update-pl
    Service Account: Pipeline
    Docker Registry: us.icr.io/project-name or docker.hub.io/projectname
        
# Deploy pipelines without Version Control 
You can but not recommended non-version control your pipelines by running the following command

``` bash
oc apply --recursive --filename pipelines/{pick expiermental, incubator or stable}
```
